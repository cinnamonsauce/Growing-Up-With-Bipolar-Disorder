         <p>When I first learned about Bipolar Disorder, it was still called "Manic Depression" by medical professionals. I was about eight years old when my father's mood swings became so pronounced, I was taken to my elementary school's counseling office to be told my father had a "chemical imbalance," and that he'd need to be monitored very closely from now on. </p>

                <p>Yet no amount of explanation could help me comprehend my father's increasingly erratic behavior. My once happy-go-lucky, fun dad became someone I no longer recognized, locking himself in his bedroom for weeks, only to abruptly emerge, exuberant and energetic. I could sense the discomfort in my parents' friends and acquaintances when they stopped by: the shifting in seats, the vague excuses for their early departure. I noted the hushed tones of my mother's phone conversations to her friends, her sister, her parents. I knew adults felt something was wrong, and that I, a child, could do nothing about it.</p>

                <p>I could do little more than watch as my father's condition worsened. Upon my parent's divorce, at age ten I spent weeks at a time caring for him and my younger siblings on our extended visits. Though he once delighted in the art of cuisine,  and loved to cook for the family with creative new recipes, I now worried about him eating at all. I took to preparing meals and leaving them at his locked bedroom door. I was hopeful when dishes disappeared, but devastated when they remained untouched. It was as if everything that made him himself had shrunk away. I couldn't help but feel like everyone who knew he was struggling didn't know what they could do for him. It was as if all we could do was wait and hope. </p>
                
                <p>
                Within two years, he was dead.
                </p>
            
                
                
                <img class="d-block img-fluid" src="https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/1597026077094a9cc.jpg" alt="Photo of child's handwriting"><div class="caption">Line from a poem I wrote at age 11, in the wake of my father's death.</div>

                <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-12 col-md-10">
                <p>I never envisioned a future without my father, yet it continued on somehow. My siblings and I stayed with relatives in The Philippines as my mother sorted out our family's affairs back home. It was a dark time, and yet I did everything I could to stay positive. I did kid stuff: I played with dolls, drew pictures, watched cartoons, wrote childish poetry.</p>
                
                <p>
                I was told Bipolar Disorder was hereditary. Once my father was diagnosed with it, the grandmother I never met—my father's mother—was speculated to have had the condition as well. Yet, for some reason I never thought that I would eventually have it, too. When I started experiencing mood swings at age 14, I, like everyone else in my family, chalked them up to teenage hormones. 
                </p>
                
                
                <img class="d-block img-fluid" src="https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/15970864907805a3e.jpg" alt="Photo of teenage girl at home"><div class="caption">Me at age 14, around the onset of my symptoms.</div>
                
                <p>
                Yet it became increasingly more difficult to make sense of the severe cognitive and emotional symptoms I began to suffer. I started having auditory hallucinations, alternated between delusions of both grandeur and persecution, and had intense compulsions to self-harm. During more lucid moments, I could reflect on my experiences more coherently. But even then, I was troubled.
                
                
                </p>

                <p>Shaking and barely able to utter the words, "I think I need to see a doctor," I stood before my mother, knowing I had to seek help before I lost complete control. The racing thoughts and inexplicable euphoria, followed by crushing melancholy, was more than I could bear. I knew my mom wouldn't take me seriously, so I wasn't surprised when she dismissed my plea to make an appointment. It wasn't until a year later, at age 16, that I finally got the chance to see a psychiatrist, and when he asked me what was wrong, I was so ashamed of my self-perceived weakness, I asked for a piece of paper while choking back tears. I could only write it down.
                
                </p>
                
                <img class="d-block img-fluid" src="https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/15970872008c2cedc.jpg" alt="Photo of a female high school graduate"><div class="caption">Me at age 17, on the day of my high school graduation.</div>
                
                <p> With psychiatric treatment and therapy, I salvaged my erratic grades and graduated high school. I went to community college and worked in restaurants to make my way through general education, but I experienced constant setbacks with managing my illness. I didn't know then that it is common for patients with Bipolar Disorder to discontinue treatment, because of undesirable medicinal side-effects, or even because one simply feels so confident and healthy once the treatment starts working. It's not easy to admit you need to be medically supervised, or to be constantly vigilant in order to function. I personally experienced a bit of both. I went through more combinations of medications than I can remember, most of which made me feel ill, or sedate. When I did start to feel like myself again, it was hard to keep my commitment to my mental health, and before I knew it, the misery that was all too familiar would return.
                
                </p>
                
                <p>
                I ended up being admitted to UC Berkeley at age 20, after a period of academic productivity. Yet it was short-lived. I was again stuck in the same crushing cycle of my illness. I withdrew two semesters later, lost and disillusioned. I was tired. I truly felt there was nothing left for me. 
                
                
                </p>
                
                <p>
                My only solace was in music and writing. I had always loved to sing and play piano, and as a teen I taught myself guitar when I stumbled upon my father's dusty collection of instruments, stashed away in a closet. He himself was a musician, and the only person I knew who would undertand what I was going through, so it was an emotional outlet for me over the years. After quitting school, I immersed myself in writing songs and performing, playing local venues and house shows, working two jobs, and just generally trying to function with my ever-present cognitive and emotional instability.

                <p>But it was only a matter of time before my illness would catch up to me. I had ended up in the hospital in the past for attempted suicide, and this time, at 26, I was driven in a cop car, in my bathrobe. I remember little else except feeling like I cared immensely about my state of mind, but not at all for my life. </p>
                
                <p>Looking back, I understand that I was incredibly fortunate enough to access care at the time. I still qualified as a dependent for health insurance, and I was able to get the treatment I so desperately needed. This incident was different from the others: upon release from the hospital, I was placed in a partial hospitalization program, one that focused on a more comprehensive treatment, combining medication with group and individual therapy, as well as cognitive behaviorial techniques to better monitor one's moods before they become unmanageable.

                <p>Most of all, it helped to be able to share my story and hear the stories of others with Bipolar Disorder. The fact that the patients I met were from varied racial and economic backgrounds showed me that this was an issue that affects people from all walks of life. This wasn't just about me and my personal dysfunctions. It was about healing a community. </p>
                
                <p> Today, in 2020, I am happy to say I was able to stabilize my condition, finish my degree at UC Berkeley (I am actually an hour away from turning in my very last assignment as a Cal student!), and live life without feeling defined by mental illness. Yet I know there is still much work to be done. Far too many of us cannot pay for healthcare at all, or do not have access to information on how to get treatment. </p>
                    
                <p>However, I am still glad to see that public awareness of mental illness has increased over the years, especially in comparison to my father's time. As for me, I will continue to advocate for the destigmatization of mental disorders--for without that, I never could have healed.   </p>
